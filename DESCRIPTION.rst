The **image-dataset-converter** library allows the conversion between
various dataset formats for image annotation datasets.
Filters can be supplied as well, e.g., for cleaning up the data.

Dataset formats:

- image classification: ADAMS (r/w), sub-dir (r/w)
- object detection: ADAMS (r/w), OPEX (r/w), ROI (r/w), YOLO (r/w)
- image segmentation: TODO
